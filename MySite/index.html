           <p>I am a traditional Chinese girl.  I lived in China for 22 yaers. Two yaers ago, I immgrated to America. I need to face many challenges in the new life. Everything was hard, and language is one of the things I want to learn most because it is the most effctive way to communicate with others.  I think I can do it well in my future. In the other ways, I like design and using sofeware to show what are my ideas. I have gotten a lot of confidence from design. I believemyself! I will achieve my dream! </p>
